# Additional information about keyboards for 5250-series terminals

## Major physical keyboard layouts

[SA21-9247-6 IBM 5250 Information Display System __Functions Reference Manual__, Seventh Edition (March 1987) page 2-118](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/5250_5251/SA21-9247-6_IBM_5250_Information_Display_System_Functions_Reference_Manual_198703.pdf#page=170) has diagrams of the first four major layouts described below.  The two 122-key layouts differ only in scan codes, not key locations.

### "5250/5251 Typewriter", "5250/5251 Data processing", "Standard"

These are reasonably different from a modern keyboard, but not as different as the __5250/5251 Data entry__ variant described below.

Further information and photos are available from [Admiral Shark's Keyboards](https://sharktastica.co.uk/wiki/ibm-model-b#525X-83).

### "5250/5251 Data entry"

In contrast to the __5250/5251 Typewriter__ keyboard, these have neither a dedicated numeric keypad, nor numeric keys in the row above the alphabetic keys.  Instead, they have a numeric keypad that is overlaid with the alphabetic keys, similar many modern laptops.

These keyboards were available with a __Proof Arrangement Feature__, which meant that the numeric keypad overlay was arranged like a modern keyboard, with <kbd>7</kbd>, <kbd>8</kbd> and <kbd>9</kbd> at the top.  By default - without this feature - the numeric keypad was arranged with <kbd>7</kbd>, <kbd>8</kbd> and <kbd>9</kbd> at the bottom.  Reference: [GA21-9246-4 IBM 5250 Information Display System __Introduction__, Fifth Edition (January 1980) page 27](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/5250_5251/GA21-9246-4_5250_Information_Display_System_Introduction_Jan80.pdf#page=34)

### "Enhanced"

These have almost the same physical layout as a standard PC 101 or 102-key keyboard, but they have an additional key in place of the top half of the numeric keypad <kbd>+</kbd> key.  Many of the non-alphanumeric keys have different labels though.

* US: 102 keys
* Japan: 104 keys
* Other: 103 keys

### "122-key Typewriter", "122-key Data processing"

These may also be referred to as "3180 Model 2" (or "3180-2") "and 3196" data processing keyboards.

The most obvious additions vs. an __Enhanced__ keyboard are a second row of function keys (<kbd>F13</kbd> through <kbd>F24</kbd>) at the top of the keyboard, 10 keys on the left which bear some similarity to those on a __Standard__ keyboard, and a modified layout for the cursor keys.

There is also a 124-key Japanese Katakana variant.

### "122-key Data entry"

Similarly to the other 122-key layout, these may be referred to as "3180-2 and 3196".  Reference: [5250 Information Display System to System/36, System/38, and Application System/400 System Units __Product Attachment Information__ (October 1989) page 199](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/5250_5251/5250_Information_Display_System_to_S36_S38_AS400_System_Units_Product_Attachment_Information_198910.pdf#page=217)

These appear to have keys in the same locations as a __122-key Typewriter__ keyboard, but some generate different scan codes, and they presumably have different labels.

Most documentation shows the typewriter layout first, or only the typewriter layout, so these do not appear to have been the standard 122-key variant.

## Other information

[S131-0620-4 IBM __5251 Display Station Models 1 and 11 Parts Catalog__, Fifth Edition (June 1979)](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/5250_5251/S131-0620-4_5251_Display_Station_Models_1_and_11_Parts_Catalog_Jun79.pdf) provides some additional information about *Standard*/*Typewriter-like* and *Data processing* keyboards:
* Page 5 lists the available combinations of major variant and region/language/layout.
* Pages 8-18 show part numbers by key number/position and language for the major variants.  These part numbers do not appear to be defined elsewhere, but can be used to make some comparisons between language variants where no photos or layout diagrams are available.
